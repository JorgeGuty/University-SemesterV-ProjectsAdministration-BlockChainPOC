A blockchain proof of concept intended to clarify its usefulness in a project.

It has a basic blockchain implementation coded in python, with a Flask REST API to handle the three simple requests. A basic frontend was implemented in Java JFrames to call these requests and visualize their results.

For the basic blockchain implementation in python I used the following article's tutorial:
